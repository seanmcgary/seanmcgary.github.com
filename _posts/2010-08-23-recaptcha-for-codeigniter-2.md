Every time I make a new website with a user registration, I usually end up using a reCaptcha somewhere in the process. A while ago, I discovered [a reCaptcha library](http://codeigniter.com/wiki/ReCAPTCHA) on the Codeigniter forums. And since then, Ive modified it a little bit to work with [Codeigniter 2.0](http://bitbucket.org/ellislab/codeigniter)and have placed it [on Github](http://github.com/seanmcgary/Codeigniter2-reCaptcha) where everyone can access it. Below is just an example of the Controller (included in the repository) so you can see how it all comes together.
