in my free time lately, I have been building a web application to refresh the wiki market. [MarkdownWiki](http://markdownwiki.com) is a new cloud hosted platform that allows users to create and collaborate wiki pages. It preserves the original purpose of wikis - provide a place for users to present their knowledge, information, notes, documentation. The possibilites have become endless. 

The reason I started building MarkdownWiki was to build a wiki platform that was up-to-date with today's latest and greatest technologies. The first thing that I decied to start with was building an editor that makes editing and creating wikis easy for everyone (maybe even for my own mother!). [In this post on the MarkdownWiki blog](http://blog.markdownwiki.com/2012/05/25/refreshing-wiki-editing-with-markdown/), I talk about the built in editor and how it will make creating wiki pages many times easier than it currently is.
