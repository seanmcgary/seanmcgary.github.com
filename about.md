For those that dont know me, or couldnt tell from the domain name, my name is Sean McGary. I am currently a Software Engineer working for [Klout.com](http://klout.com). In this blog you will find a variety of things, mainly ramblings on various things that I find interesting such as photography, technology, and anything else I feel like it. I mostly like to blog about things that I have learned something from or projects that I happen to be working on in my free time. A lot of things that I post are things that Ive recently learned that I find useful that I havent been able to find an all inclusive guide about. So feel free to explore, comment, and share a post if you find it interesting. Here are some other places that you can find me:
